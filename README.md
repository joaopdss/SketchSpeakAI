# SketchSpeakAI

## How to run?
* You need to manually set the API_KEY of your OpenAI's account, you can make one through this [link](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
* Run **main.py**
* Show the palm of your hand to webcam (if it is not detecting well, try to make the background cleaner and having more lights on you)
* Hold your index and middle fingers up to select pencil, rubber icons or colors palette (pencil is drawing mode, rubber is erasing mode)
* Use your index finger to draw and erase (based on your selected mode) 
* If you want to generate PPTX slides just hold your index and middle fingers and go to "Start Recording", after speaking what is necessary and drawing, do the same process again but this time click on "Stop Recording". The script will automatically generate the PPTX file for you.
